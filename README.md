DeepaMehta 4 Kiezatlas - Angebote
=================================

A DeepaMehta 4 plugin and extension for Kiezatlas 2 (see @mukil/dm4-kiezatlas).

We created this plugin so that new users who offer social-cultural activities will be able to

* easily create and manage their public infos about _Angebote_ (Offers)
* and "time-reference" those to all existing Kiezatlas _Geo Objects_

As a result of this work, next to _Geo Objects_, the [Kiezatlas 2 API](http://kreise.kiezatlas.de/pages/api-documentation) will be able to answer geo-spatial, thematic and time-range requests for _Activities_, too.
